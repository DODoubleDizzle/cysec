The SDLC is a process that ensures that security is considered at every phase of software development. It typically involves the following stages:

## 0.1 Planning
- Define the security requirements for the project.
- Identify potential security risks and mitigation strategies.
## 0.2 Design
- Design the software architecture with security in mind.
- Conduct threat modeling to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- Design security controls and privacy measures.
## 0.3 Implementation
- Write secure code by following best practices and secure coding guidelines.
- Use automated tools for static code analysis to detect vulnerabilities early.
- Perform regular code reviews with a focus on security.
## 0.4 Testing
- Conduct various security tests, such as penetration testing, dynamic analysis, and vulnerability scanning.
- Include security testing as part of the continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline.
## 0.5 Deployment
- Ensure that the deployment process includes security checks and validations.
- Use secure configurations and harden the production environment.
- Monitor the application for security incidents and vulnerabilities.
## 0.6 Maintenance
- Regularly update the application to address new vulnerabilities.
- Continuously monitor for security threats and perform regular security audits.
- Provide security patches and updates promptly.
