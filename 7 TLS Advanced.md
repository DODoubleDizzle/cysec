# 1 Trust in a digital society
Building trust in the online environment is key to economic and social development 
- Lack of trust, in particular because of a perceived lack of legal certainty, makes consumers, businesses and public authorities hesitate to carry out transactions electronically and to adopt new services 
- Main barriers to the digital economy identified by the Digital Agenda for Europe:
	- **Fragmentation** 
		- *refers to the scenario where services, standards, and practices are not uniform or consistent across different regions or sectors.
	- Lack of **interoperability** 
		- *means the inability of different systems, platforms, or applications to work together effectively or exchange information seamlessly*
	- Rise in cybercrime 
	- missing eID and trust services that would provide a common foundation for secure electronic interaction

# 2 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
## 2.1 What is a PKI
A PKI is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption

## 2.2 What is a PKI intended for
The role of the Public Key Infrastructure is to provide clear and reliable answers to the following questions:
- Is the key valid at the time of signing
- Who is the owner of the key
- What is the key used for
- Is it still valid
- Does the key truly correspond to a certain domain
## 2.3 How is it used
A PKI is used to bind a public key to an identity of a person or an organisation
- The binding is performed with 
	- A registration process by a Registration Authority (RA) and 
	- An issuance of a certificate by a Certificate Authority (CA) 
- The CA itself can be validated to be able to perform this service by an independent Validation Authority (VA). 
- The visible artifact of the binding is called a certificate (From Latin: certus for certain, assured and facere = to make, to create)
