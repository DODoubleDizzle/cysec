# 1 Signing using RSA
## 1.1 Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
RSA is going to be too slow because we always want bigger keys so this is its alternative.
It cant be used for encryption, only for signing


# 2 The hash function
wow such hash mhhhh many encrypt yes
Takes a message of any lenght and returns a pseudorandom hash of fixed length, meaning for any input of any length a different output is generated with fixed length.
